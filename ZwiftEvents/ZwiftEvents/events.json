This bypasses the usual flat London start so you can get climbing quickly ‚Äì let the suffering begin!\n\nOnce you‚Äôre in the Surrey Hills, you will continue to ride this route, never going back into the city or crossing the start/finish banner.\n\nYou‚Äôll ride up 4 timed KOM climbs on this route. First Fox Hill for the lead-in, then the route begins atop Fox/Box. Next you‚Äôll climb Leith hill ‚Äì the longest climb of the day.\n\nOne weird thing about how this route works is it dumps you onto the Box Hill KOM after the start line, which means you won‚Äôt get on the Box Hill leaderboard in Zwift. But you will climb (almost) all of it!\n\nThen it‚Äôs on to Keith Hill, then one final go up Fox Hill. The route ends at the KOM banner atop Fox/Box.",

The climb to Alp d‚ÄôHuez actually has two different finish points: the ‚Äútourist version‚Äù and the Tour de France version. Alpe du Zwift matches the tourist version, which is ~2km shorter with 40 meters less climbing than the TdF. In all, Alpe du Zwift is 12.24km (7.6 miles) long, with a total elevation gain of over 1000 meters (3400‚Ä≤)!",
