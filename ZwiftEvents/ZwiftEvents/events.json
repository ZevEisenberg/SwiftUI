First Fox Hill for the lead-in, then the route begins atop Fox/Box. Next you‚Äôll climb Leith hill ‚Äì the longest climb of the day.\n\nOne weird thing about how this route works is it dumps you onto the Box Hill KOM after the start line, which means you won‚Äôt get on the Box Hill leaderboard in Zwift. But you will climb (almost) all of it!\n\nThen it‚Äôs on to Keith Hill, then one final go up Fox Hill. The route ends at the KOM banner atop Fox/Box.",

Alpe du Zwift matches the tourist version, which is ~2km shorter with 40 meters less climbing than the TdF. In all, Alpe du Zwift is 12.24km (7.6 miles) long, with a total elevation gain of over 1000 meters (3400‚Ä≤)!",
