# SwiftUI

This repo contains SwiftUI code which showcases [View](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view) components like `List`, `AsyncImage`, [Property Wrappers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/model-data) like [@Binding](binding.md) and much more SwiftyUI snacks. I've also created a few sample SwiftUI apps which you will find below. `Text("Enjoy!")`

try? it out. 

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Image("swiftui-logo")
            Text("SwiftUI")
                .foregroundColor(.white)
                .font(.largeTitle)
                .bold()
                .padding(.bottom, 20)
            Text("SwiftUI helps you build great-looking apps across all Apple platforms with the power of Swift ‚Äî and surprisingly little code. You can bring even better experiences to everyone, on any Apple device, using just one set of tools and APIs.")
                .multilineTextAlignment(.center)
                .foregroundColor(.white)
        }
        .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: .infinity)
        .background(.black)
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}
```
